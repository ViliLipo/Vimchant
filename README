vim 7.0 introduced excellent spell-checking features which made external spell-checker plugins pretty much obsolete. unfortunately not all languages can be supported through vims dictionary format. either the language is morphologically too complex or better custom solutions exist already for some languagessolutions which are not compatible with vims spelling checker. finnish, for example, is a language which doesnt currently benefit from vims spell-checking features.

this plugin (vimchant) provides a simple but fast on-the-fly spelling checker which uses enchant as its back-end program. enchant is a spell-checker library and utility included in modern gnu/linux systems. enchant itself is only a front-end for many different spell-checkers, including voikko, zemberek, hunspell, hspell, uspell, myspell, aspell and ispell. all the spell-checkers and languages which can be supported through enchant are available to vim through this plugin.

manual for vimchant is included, just type

    :help vimchant.txt

the most interesting commands are \ss (spell-checker on/off) and \sl (change language). the default interval period before running the spell-check is rather long (4 seconds). to make the spell-checker respond faster (1 second, for example) add the following line to your .vimrc file:

    set updatetime=1000
